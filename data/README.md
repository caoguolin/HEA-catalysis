# Data for "HEA-catalysis"

_**All raw data in the project were calculated using density functional theory(DFT) method.**_

### The raw data includes the adsorption energies of -O/-OH and the density of state(DOS) data for the HEA surfaces.

#### The files name _**'O adsorption.json'**_ and _**'OH adsorption.json'**_ include the adsorption energy, adsorption site coordinate and adsorption local environment of each adsorption structure. Where we have constructed over 8000 different adsorption structures in total.

#### And the file name _**'dos.json'**_ include the electronic properties of metal atoms on HEA surface:
##### _**Coordinate**_

##### _**d-band center**_

##### _**Mean suqared d-band width**_

##### _**d-band filling fraction**_

##### _**d-band electron number**_

#### We constructed 100 different HEA slabs, each with a surface containing 9 metal atoms.
